    content:`"Curry leaves, with their citrusy aroma and subtle bitterness, play a vital role in enhancing the flavors of dal, chutneys, and rasams, making them an indispensable ingredient in the vibrant South Indian culinary heritage. These aromatic leaves serve as a go-to garnish, infusing a delightful essence into a wide array of South Indian delicacies.

    The story behind the botanical name of curry leaves, Murraya koenigii, is deeply fascinating, dating back to 13th century India. Krish Ashok, author of Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking, took to Instagram to share this with his followers.
    
    “If you ask any person from South India what their favourite garnish is, it is quite likely to be deep fried crisp curry leaves. The flavour profile of this leaf is irreplaceable, a fact that south Indian NRIs regularly cry about as they pay 5 USD for a sad looking bunch in a tiny ziploc bag. The fresh leaf has both a citrusy zing and a mild sulphurous note (from 1-phenylethanethiol) that lends dishes that have a lot of curry leaves a savoury and meaty flavour,” he wrote.Calling the story behind its botanical name far more interesting than the description of its taste, Ashok shared how two men with the same name — Johan and Johann are responsible for it.
    
    “Johan Andreas Murray was a Swedish doctor of German ancestry, and he was a pioneering pharmacologist who wrote a six-volume compendium of herbal remedies and Johan Gerhard Koenig was a German botanist who travelled to India as part of the Tranquebar mission in 1706, which incidentally first printed the Bible in Tamil. Doctor Koenig later joined the service of the Nawabs of Arcot. The Nawabs themselves were the descendants of Turkish mercenaries who were invited by Sundara Pandyan IV who was dealing with a civil war in the 13th century. As the Nawabs lost territory to the British, doctor Koeing eventually became a naturalist with the British East India Company and worked in Madras. He travelled all over South India documenting local plants,” he shared.
    
    He added that one of the things that Johan Gerhard Koenig wrote about was the use of winged termites as food in South India. “These by the way are the annoying clueless flies that arrive during the rainy season. They are often collected, roasted and tempered with sesame oil, garlic and curry leaves,” he explained.He then shared that the botanical name of the curry leaf comes from these two Johan’s – Johan Andreas MURRAY and Johann Gerhard KOENIG — Murraya koenigii.
    
    Fascinating, isn’t it.
    
    Curry leaves are also packed with nutrients and are very beneficial for health. Speaking with indianexpress.com, Ushakiran Sisodia, Registered Dietician and Clinical Nutritionist, Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai shared, “Curry leaves, or ‘kadi patta’, offer numerous health benefits. They aid in digestion, are rich in antioxidants, promote hair and eye health, help regulate blood sugar levels, and can support heart health by reducing bad cholesterol.”

    content:`"Are you getting enough protein in your diet? While you may watch your calories, sugar and salt intake, you should also make sure you are ingesting enough protein. It plays a key role in the creation and maintenance of every cell in our bodies. It fuels our cells and powers our bodies.

    Nancy Waldeck, chef and dietitian at Thomas F. Chapman Family Cancer Wellness at Piedmont, points out that our bodies do not store protein.
    
    “It is important for individuals to consume protein every day. Daily protein intake plays a role in keeping your cells in good shape and should be part of your daily health maintenance plan.”
    
    Protein is made up of amino acids, commonly known as building blocks, because they are attached in long chains. It is also considered a “macronutrient,” meaning that you need relatively large amounts of it to stay healthy.
    
    Why your body needs protein
    Here are five compelling reasons why you should make sure you are getting enough protein every day:
    
    1. Build. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage and skin. In fact, your hair and nails are comprised mostly of protein.
    
    2. Repair. Your body uses it to build and repair tissue.
    
    3. Oxygenate. Red blood cells contain a protein compound that carries oxygen throughout the body. This helps supply your entire body with the nutrients it needs.
    
    4. Digest. About half the dietary protein that you consume each day goes into making enzymes, which aids in digesting food, and making new cells and body chemicals.
    
    5. Regulate. Protein plays an important role in hormone regulation, especially during the transformation and development of cells during puberty.
    
    How protein can help you stay in shape
    Eating high-protein foods has many fitness benefits, including:
    
    Speeding recovery after exercise and/or injury
    Reducing muscle loss
    Building lean muscle
    Helping maintain a healthy weight
    Curbing hunger
    Waldeck points out another benefit of protein — it fills you up faster.
    
    “Protein plus fiber keeps us full longer, which means you don’t feel the urge to eat as often. This helps keep weight down while fueling our cells with the right nutrients they need.”"`,

    heading:"Food Crisis",
    content:`"The UN's recent estimate has raised concerns about the accuracy of the Indian government's reported figures on food assistance needs. Contrary to the government's claim that 813 million people in India require food assistance, the UN report suggests that over a billion people couldn't afford a healthy diet in 2021. According to the 2023 report on food security and nutrition by five UN agencies, 74.1% of Indians, approximately 1.043 billion people, were unable to afford a healthy diet in 2021. The report also indicates India's proportion of undernourished population at 16.6% during 2020-2022.

    The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) released the report amid criticism from food security advocates and nutrition experts who accuse the Indian government of downplaying food deprivation and poor nutrition issues. The government disputes the FAO's estimate of 16.6%, citing a small sample size and biased methodology.
    
    Despite the government's denial, some experts see a contradiction between the FAO estimate and the government's own acknowledgment that around 813 million people require food assistance. The recent approval of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), providing free food grain to 813 million people, further adds to the discrepancy.
    
    The Right to Food Campaign aligns with the FAO estimate, stating that over a billion people need food aid. The reliance on the 2011 census for the 813 million estimate is criticized, as the next census is overdue by two years, potentially leaving many needy individuals without the necessary ration cards.
    
    A study based on the National Family Health Survey 2021 reveals alarming trends, indicating that a significant portion of the population, especially among the poorest households, lacks access to essential nutrients. S.V. Subramanian, a professor at Harvard University, finds the government's count of 813 million people needing food aid surprising and larger than suggested by conventional measures of undernutrition.
    
    This controversy follows the Union's denial of India's low ranking on the Global Hunger Index earlier this year, dismissing it as an erroneous measure with serious methodological issues and malafide intent."`,

Beyond a mere exploration of gardening or food, the book delves into the profound interconnection of food, nutrition, nature, and culture. Initially introduced in 'First Food: A Taste of India’s Biodiversity' in 2013, the authors emphasized the intrinsic link between food diversity and biological diversity. The disappearance of biodiversity, whether in the wild, on farms, or in oceans, threatens the unique culinary traditions of each region. As the world succumbs to the allure of multinational, industrialized, and chemically processed foods, the book advocates for the preservation and celebration of biodiversity on our plates. It brings forth a plethora of recipes in 'First Food: Culture of Taste,' reinforcing the belief that India can chart a distinct and healthier food journey. The narrative unfolds the calculated maneuvers of the food industry, as illustrated in Michael Moss's 'Salt, Sugar and Fat,' where the industry strategically introduced processed and convenience foods, altering societal eating habits. The demise of home economics and the rise of processed foods transformed food into a convenient, pre-cooked commodity, setting the stage for a global shift in dietary habits. The book urges a reclamation of traditional culinary knowledge, emphasizing the need to appreciate and protect the biodiversity that sustains generations. In the face of the concrete-covered natural habitats and industrial threats to biodiversity, 'First Food' serves as a guide to rediscovering and treasuring the knowledge embedded in our ancestral recipes. It envisions a culinary revival that harmonizes nutrition, nature, and livelihoods, emphasizing the transformative power of reconnecting with the essence of our lives—food, nutrition, and nature.""`,

    heading:"Jil Jil Jigarthanda",
    content:`"Jigarthanda, the iconic cold beverage from Madurai, holds a special place in the hearts of locals and visitors alike. Originating from humble beginnings in the 1970s, the 'Famous' Jigarthanda shop near Vilakkuthoon in Madurai has become synonymous with this refreshing drink. Comprising ingredients like milk, almond pisin, khoya, sarsaparilla root syrup (nannari sarbat syrup), and toppings like basundi and milk ice cream, jigarthanda's rich, creamy texture makes it a popular choice, especially during the scorching heat of July.

    Despite its deep-rooted connection with Madurai, the name 'jigarthanda' raises questions about its Tamil origins. According to Sheik Mohideen, Brand Chef at Savya Rasa, the concept of jigarthanda shares similarities with the northern drink falooda, with slight variations in ingredients. While theories abound regarding its origin and potential mentions in historical texts like Ain-i-Akbari, scholars like Salma Yusuf Husain, a Persian scholar and author, refute such claims, asserting that the name 'jigarthanda' is Urdu, suggesting a more recent origin.
    
    The 'Famous' Jigarthanda shop, founded by Sheikh Abdul Kadhar, began as a pushcart in the 1970s and later became a permanent fixture in Madurai. With loyal patrons numbering in the thousands, the shop serves around a thousand glasses of the drink daily. The concoction includes condensed and chilled cow's milk, fresh milk, cream, almond pisin, sugar syrup, nannari sherbet syrup, basundi, and milk ice cream. Depending on customer preferences, it comes in variations like ordinary jigarthanda, special jigarthanda, or jigarthanda ice cream.
    
    While there are competing theories about the drink's origin, one interesting perspective ties it to the coastal region between Pudukkottai and Ramanathapuram. Vani C Chenguttuwan, a historian, suggests that the influence for jigarthanda might have come from this coastal area, emphasizing the cultural impact of southeast Asia on Tamil Nadu's cuisine. The almond pisin, a crucial ingredient in jigarthanda, could have been seaweed or agar-agar in early times, indicating a historical sea connection.
    
    The seafaring traditions of Tamil Muslims dating back to the 13th century further support the idea that the drink's earlier versions might have been conceptualized by seafarers who needed protein, with seaweed being an accessible source. The term 'kadarpasi' (seaweed in Tamil) is still colloquially used for almond pisin. Jigarthanda's journey from the streets of Madurai to international recognition, including a batch being flown to Singapore, reflects its enduring popularity and cultural significance."`,

    Cuisine leaves its own imprint on history. India has witnessed many invaders; with every invader came a different culture and new cuisine. Muslim invaders like Turks, Arabs, Persians, and Afghans introduced the culture of feasts to India. The Mughlai cuisine that India is famous for developed from the 15th century to about the 19th century during the reign of the Mughals. The Mughals raised cooking to an art form, introducing several recipes to India like biryani, pilaf, and kebabs.
    
    While biryani is popularly associated with the Mughals, there is some historical evidence to show that there were other, similar rice dishes prior to the Mughal invasion. There is mention of a rice dish known as “Oon Soru” in Tamil as early as the year 2 A.D. Oon Soru was composed of rice, ghee, meat, turmeric, coriander, pepper, and bay leaf, and was used to feed military warriors.The famous traveler and historian Al-Biruni has precise descriptions of meals at the courts of Sultans who ruled parts of India prior to the Mughals. These also contain mentions of rice dishes similar to the Mughal biryani. However, there is no doubt that Islamic Persians inspired and popularized the dish.The word “biryani” comes from the Persian word “birian” which means “fried before cooking.” One could conclude that the biryani originated in Iran (previously known as Persia). Another interesting story traces the origins of the dish to Mumtaz Mahal (1593-1631), Shah Jahan’s queen who inspired the Taj Mahal. It is said that she once visited army barracks and found the army personnel under-nourished. She asked the chef to prepare a special dish that provided balanced nutrition, and thus the biryani was created.
    
    When the British deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah to Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), the Calcutta biryani was created. Nizams governing small territories in Northern India encouraged regional variants like the Hyderabadi biryani and the Arcot Nawab biryani. Biryani recipes of the Mughals can still be found in places where their empire had a foothold.Once a dish for royalty, today the biryani reflects local sensibilities and traditions and is a popular and common dish. Here are two biryani recipes that reflect the predominantly vegetarian Indian society."`,

    content:`"Gol Gappe, Phuchka, Pani ka Bataasha or Patasha, Gup Chup, Phulki, Pakodi – all of these are names for one of India’s most favourite snacks, the Pani Puri. A small, unassuming, crispy hollow ball of fried dough, filled with potato and dunked in spicy jal jeera and meetha chutney.

    The world of Indian street food is vast, diverse, and delicious, but Pani Puri is the king. Whether you’re ordering it from a dubious vendor on a street corner or making a beeline towards the chaat stand at a wedding buffet, Pani Puri will rarely leave you disappointed.
    
    But where did this amazing food item come from?
    
    Unfortunately, the internet has little to offer when it comes to the history of the finger-licking Pani Puri. Kind of like the concept of zero, or patriarchy, it’s unclear who exactly should be given the credit. All we can put forth are the legends of this dish’s source, one stating that it first came into existence somewhere in the ancient Indian kingdom of Magadha.
    
    One of the sixteen mahajanapadas, or ‘great kingdoms’, of ancient India, the Kingdom of Magadha corresponded to what is now Southern Bihar. While the exact time frame of its existence is unclear, it reportedly existed prior to 600 BCE. Both the Maurya and Gupta Empires had their origins in Magadha, and the region has been attributed for the development of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism.
    
    Pani Puri in the kingdom of Magadha was reportedly slightly different from the dish we know and love today. Called ‘Phulki’ (a word still used to refer to Pani Puri in parts of India today), these ancient Pani Puris were made with smaller, crispier puris than those used today. What they were initially filled with is unclear, though it is likely to be some variation of the aloo sabzi (curry).
    
    However, there is another commonly believed origin of the Pani Puri. According to a legend, in the Mahabharata, Draupadi invented the Pani Puri. When the Pandava brothers, Draupadi, and their mother Kunti were in exile after losing their kingdom in a game of dice, Kunti threw Draupadi a challenge. She gave her some leftover aloo sabzi and a small amount of dough and ordered her to cook something that would satisfy all five brothers. The reason why she presented this challenge is unconfirmed — some accounts say it was to gauge if Draupadi would be a good housewife, and others say it was to see if Draupadi would favour one brother over the others. In response to Kunti’s challenge, Draupadi invented Pani Puri. Impressed by her daughter-in-law’s resourcefulness, Kunti blessed the dish with immortality.
    
    Is some unknown citizen of ancient Magadha the wonderful creator of Pani Puri? Did Draupadi invent it after being challenged by Kunti, or is this story from the Mahabharata just a way to explain the existence of this dish? We can’t say.
    
    Is Pani Puri to die for and are we all craving some now? Definitely.
